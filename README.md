This senior project at Texas A&M University's Electrical & Computer Engineering school involves the design and implementation of an engineered Solar Lighting System. 
Sub-systems are centered around a custom-designed battery charge control printed circuit board, which efficiently manages the charging process of two 18 Ah sealed lead
acid batteries from two solar panels. The energy stored in these batteries is then converted for use by a microinverter, ensuring a stable power supply to LED lights
installed at two different locations. Rated at 800W the inverter subsystem converts direct current from said battery pack to a smooth pure sine wave 120V RMS source.
Additionally, the system is integrated with a mobile Android application, enabling remote monitoring and control of the lighting system, adding a layer of convenience 
and user interactivity.
